Processing Geographical Height Map


Generative maps with Processing and P5js. 

The heightmaps are based on a perlin noise map with manipulated Level Of Detail and fallof towards a virtual map center so that there will be one broad area of higher values (mountainous region) amidst values of lower values (valleys/lakes). Colors are inspired by the Seattle Sectional Aeronautical Chart with a scale of 1:500000, and lines of latitude/longitude on Lambert Conformal Conic Projection. This is one of those pet projects that could be endlessly improved. 

P5js version (without the isoheight lines) can be found here:https://bit.ly/33gOlrh
